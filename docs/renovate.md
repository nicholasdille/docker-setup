# Renovate

`docker-setup` relys heavily on [Renovate](https://renovatebot.com/) to propose tool updates using pull requests. Renovate will automatically merge the pull requests after the tests have completed successfully.

The configuration for Renovate is generated from `renovate-root.json` as well as the `renovate` nodes in [tool manifests](manifest.md).
